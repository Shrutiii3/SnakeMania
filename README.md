# SnakeMania
## Overview
This porject is a classic Snake game developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance code structure, modularity, and maintainability. The project focuses on providing an interactive and entertaining gaming experience, showcasing proficiency in Java and graphical user interface (GUI) development.
## Features
- OOP Principles: Utilized OOP concepts to create a well-organized and easily maintainable codebase.
- Player-Controlled Snake Movement: Implemented smooth and responsive player-controlled snake movement.
- Collision Detection: Designed and integrated collision detection to manage interactions between the snake and game boundaries or itself.
- Score Tracking: Added score tracking functionality to enhance user engagement and provide a competitive aspect to the game.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Developed a user-friendly GUI for an engaging and interactive gaming experience.
## Methodology
- OOP Design: Applied Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure the codebase is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
- Game Logic: Developed core game logic including snake movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
- GUI Development: Designed a graphical user interface to enhance the gaming experience.
